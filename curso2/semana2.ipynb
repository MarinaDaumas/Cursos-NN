    "    Untill now we did batch gradient descent. We processed all our trainnig set each iteration. Mini-batching means we split our very big trainnig set into many smaller sets. \n",
    "X<sup>{t}</sup> is the t<sup>th</sup> input batch and Y<sup>{t}</sup> is the correspondig expected output.\n",

    "\n",
    "Its faster than batch gradient descent because the wheight are updeted many times each iterations instead of only one."
